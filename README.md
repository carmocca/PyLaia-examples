# PyLaia examples

This repository contains experiments for KWS and HTR using [PyLaia](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia).

> **Disclaimer**: The easiest experiment to follow is the [IAM example for HTR](iam-htr). Experiments inside the `legacy` directory have not been updated to the latest PyLaia version.
