# PyLaia examples

This repository contains experiments for KWS and HTR using [PyLaia](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia).

> **Disclaimer**: The easiest experiment to follow is the [IAM example for HTR](iam-htr). Some experiments may be currently broken. Apologies for not having better documentation at this moment, we will keep improving it and adding other examples.
